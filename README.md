# Chat Web Application

This is a basic chat web application implemented using Rust for the server-side code and JavaScript for the client-side code.

## Server-side Rust Code

To run the server, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your system.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the server-side Rust code.

3. Open a terminal window and run the following command:


```shell
cargo run
```

This will compile and start the Rust server.

4. Once the server is running, you can access the chat application by visiting `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.
